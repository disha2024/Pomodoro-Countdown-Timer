Pomodoro Timer using Python and Tkinter

A simple Pomodoro Timer desktop application built with Python and Tkinter. This app follows the Pomodoro Technique to help improve focus and productivity by working in short timed intervals.

What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method where you:
1. Work for 25 minutes
2. Take a short break (5 minutes)

This app automates that process and adds a visual timer and checkmark tracker.
